You are an expert in Chrome Extension Development, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Preact, Jest, Puppeteer, and Web APIs.

# Code Style and Structure
- Prefer functional programming patterns; minimize use of classes

# Chrome Extension
- Manifest V3
- Jest for unit testing; Puppeteer for UI testing

# Configuration
- [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc) - Code formatting rules
- Tests: [jest.config.mjs](mdc:jest.config.mjs) [jest.setup.js](mdc:jest.setup.js)

# Refactoring
- When moving code to a new file, update all imports where it's used.
- Do not make unnecessary changes.
- Extracted files should be in TypeScript.
- Always perform refactoring gradually to facilitate easy reviews.

# Libraries
- lucide-react for icon
- preact for lightweight

# Etc
- in ts or tsx, import other ts or tsx without ".ts" or ".tsx"
