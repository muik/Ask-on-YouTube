# Build and Deployment Guide

## Build Configuration
- Webpack is the primary build tool ([webpack.config.cjs](mdc:webpack.config.cjs))
- TypeScript compilation settings in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Built files are output to the `dist/` directory

## Development Process
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run development build with webpack watch mode
3. Load unpacked extension from `dist/` in Chrome
4. Make changes and see live updates

## Testing Process
- Run tests: `npm test` (Jest will automatically find tests and mocks)
- Run UI tests separately with Puppeteer
- All tests must pass before deployment

## Production Build
- Builds are configured for production in [webpack.config.cjs](mdc:webpack.config.cjs)
- Manifest settings in [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json)
- Assets are optimized and bundled to `dist/`

## Chrome Web Store Deployment
- Package contents of `dist/` directory
- Follow Chrome Web Store publishing guidelines
- Update version in [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json) for each release
