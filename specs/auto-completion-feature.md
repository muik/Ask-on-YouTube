# Auto-Completion Feature Specification

## Overview
The auto-completion feature provides real-time suggestions as users type questions in the YouTube question dialog. It helps users formulate better questions by suggesting completions based on the video content and context.

## User Experience

### Triggering Auto-Completion
- Auto-completion activates when a user types at least 3 characters in the question textarea
- Suggestions appear directly within the input field, with the user's text in normal color and the suggested completion in a lighter gray
- A "[Tab]" indicator appears to the right of the input field to show users how to accept the suggestion

### Accepting Suggestions
- Users can press the Tab key to accept the suggested completion
- When accepted, the full suggested text replaces the current input text
- The cursor moves to the end of the accepted text
- After accepting a suggestion, no new suggestions appear until the user types additional characters

### Multi-line Support
- The question input is a textarea that supports multiple lines of text
- The textarea automatically resizes based on content, up to a maximum height
- Enter key creates a new line when Shift is pressed
- Enter key without Shift submits the question
- Auto-completion works seamlessly with multi-line content

### Visual Design
- The user's current text appears in the textarea normally
- The suggested completion appears in gray directly after the user's text within the same field
- The Tab hint appears in blue to the right of the input field
- The suggestion is non-intrusive and doesn't interfere with normal typing
- Styles of the suggestion text match the input text (font, size, line height, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Components
1. **Input Handler**
   - Debounced event listener for input changes (300ms delay)
   - Minimum character threshold (3 characters)
   - Prevents suggestion spam after accepting a completion
   - Auto-resizes textarea based on content

2. **Suggestion Retrieval**
   - Sends request to background script with:
     - Current text (questionStart)
     - Video information (id, title, caption)
   - Processes response to ensure proper text completion
   - Handles case sensitivity and text duplication issues

3. **Suggestion Display**
   - Creates and positions suggestion text within the input container
   - Applies consistent styling via CSS
   - Shows current text + suggested completion
   - Includes Tab key hint
   - Supports multi-line text display

4. **Suggestion Acceptance**
   - Tab key event handler
   - Updates input value with full suggestion
   - Clears suggestion display
   - Prevents immediate new suggestions

### Data Flow
1. User types in the textarea
2. Textarea auto-resizes to fit content
3. After 300ms debounce, if text is â‰¥3 characters, request is sent to background script
4. Background script processes request and returns completed question
5. Suggestion is displayed within the input field
6. User can press Tab to accept or continue typing
7. If Tab is pressed, suggestion is applied to input field

### Error Handling
- Clears suggestions when input is too short
- Handles case sensitivity issues between user input and suggestions
- Prevents duplicate text in suggestions
- Handles dialog closing with proper cleanup
- Logs detailed debugging information to console

## Edge Cases

### Handled Edge Cases
- **Backspace handling**: Clears suggestions without removing the input form
- **Short input**: No suggestions shown for fewer than 3 characters
- **Suggestion acceptance**: Prevents suggestion spam after accepting
- **Dialog closing**: Properly cleans up suggestions when dialog is closed
- **Case sensitivity**: Preserves user's casing while matching suggestions case-insensitively
- **Text duplication**: Prevents duplicate text like "whyWhy..." in suggestions
- **Multi-line text**: Properly handles line breaks and text wrapping
- **Enter key behavior**: Differentiates between new line (Shift+Enter) and submission (Enter)

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider
- **Very long suggestions**: May need scrolling for extremely long completions
- **Special characters**: Ensure proper handling of special characters in suggestions
- **Multiple suggestions**: Could be extended to show multiple options
- **Mobile support**: Touch interaction for accepting suggestions
- **Internationalization**: Support for non-Latin characters and RTL languages

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test with various input lengths
- Test with multi-line input
- Verify Tab key acceptance works
- Test Enter and Shift+Enter behavior
- Check auto-resizing with different content lengths
- Verify cleanup when dialog is closed
- Test with different casing (e.g., "Why" vs "why")
- Test with special characters and non-Latin text

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for suggestion display logic
- Integration tests for data flow
- End-to-end tests for user interaction

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple suggestion options
- Keyboard navigation between suggestions
- Highlighting matching parts of suggestions
- Learning from user acceptance patterns
- Customizable suggestion appearance
- Rich text formatting support

## Implementation Notes

### Background Script Integration
The feature relies on the `GET_QUESTION_COMPLETE` action in the background script, which:
- Takes the current text and video information as input
- Uses AI to generate a contextually relevant completion
- Returns the completed question text

### Performance Considerations
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- Suggestion display is lightweight and non-blocking
- Cleanup ensures no memory leaks when dialog is closed
- Efficient textarea resizing minimizes layout thrashing

### Accessibility
- Tab key is a standard keyboard shortcut for completion
- Visual indicator makes the feature discoverable
- High contrast between text and background ensures readability
- Non-intrusive design doesn't interfere with normal typing
- Keyboard shortcuts (Tab, Enter, Shift+Enter) provide efficient interaction
